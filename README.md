GRIDCell
=============

GRIDCell is an scale out storage system based on GlusterFS (http://gluster.org/) using ZFS on linux (http://zfsonlinux.org/) as its underlying on-disk filesystem. It is easy to install and setup with a web based admin interface that allows for easy monitoring and administration. Saltstack is currently the underlying provisioning layer that is used.
